To fix the spacing issue, always ensure a space exists between the operator and the unit in `calc()`. For example, correct the `width:calc(100%-5px);` to `width:calc(100% - 5px);`.  For nested `calc()` expressions, make sure the parentheses are correctly nested. If you're mixing units, ensure they are compatible for the operation. It's best to maintain consistency and avoid mixing units if possible, converting them to a common unit before use in `calc()`.
