The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, if you use it with units like 'px' or 'rem', and forget to add a space between the operator and the unit, it can lead to unexpected results or parsing errors. For example, `width:calc(100%-5px);` will work, but `width:calc(100%-5px);` will likely fail.  Another common issue arises when nesting `calc()` expressions incorrectly, leading to incorrect calculations.  Using incompatible units within a single `calc()` expression will also result in errors.
